# Fraud_Detection
This is a machine learning model developed for fraud detection, created using Google Colab

Fraud detection is a set of activities undertaken to prevent money or property from being obtained through false pretenses. Fraud detection is applied to many industries such as banking or insurance. Such acts of fraud detection has financially affected a lot of individuals as well as organizations.

Unlike the old times, we can use the help of the current bleeding edge technologies to gain advantages over the scamsters. Using Machine Learning for Fraud Detection is one such example. Machine learning models are able to learn from patterns of normal behavior. They are very fast to adapt to changes in that normal behaviour and can quickly identify patterns of fraud transactions. This means that the model can identify suspicious customers even when there hasn't been a chargeback yet.
